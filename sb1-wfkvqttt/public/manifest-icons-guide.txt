PWA Icon Requirements:

For a fully functional PWA on both Android and iOS, you need:

1. pwa-64x64.png (64x64)
2. pwa-192x192.png (192x192)
3. pwa-512x512.png (512x512)
4. maskable-icon-512x512.png (512x512, maskable design)
5. apple-touch-icon.png (180x180 for iOS)

Icon Design Guidelines:
- Use the coffee bean logo or "Beans by Sam" branding
- For maskable icons, keep important content in the center 80% safe zone
- Use a solid background color (e.g., #1c1917 - stone-800)
- Ensure good contrast and legibility at all sizes

You can generate these icons using:
- Figma, Photoshop, or other design tools
- Online PWA icon generators
- The @vite-pwa/assets-generator package

Once you have your icons, replace this file and place all icon files in this public directory.
